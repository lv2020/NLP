2019-10-01,英国皇家化学学会,Workshops inspire students with chemistry,讲习班激发学生的化学知识,The workshops took place in five primary schools in the Forest of Dean during the summer term. Students who had demonstrated a keen interest in chemistry were invited to attend a morning of activities and a tour at BASF， Cinderford on 4 July.During the BASF visit， students were able to see the periodic table in action. They were taken on a tour of the production area which recycles catalytic convertors and where some of the rarest elements on earth are reclaimed. Following the tour， students took part in the BASF Science Xperience， which included making slime and a sound proofing activity. This visit was enjoyed by all.We are extremely grateful to the Outreach Fund. The grant provided us with the opportunity to expand our repertoire and promote an area of STEM that was not represented in our available workshops. As a not for profit organisation， we rely on this kind of external funding to enable us to develop new projects， increase our support for schools and develop vital links with local businesses. We would also like to thank BASF， Cinderford for hosting the visit and hope to work with them again in the future to provide more opportunities for students to experience STEM in action.,

2019-09-25,机械工程师学会,	Are good engineers automatically good leaders?,优秀的工程师会自动成为优秀的领导者吗?,Institution newsAre good engineers automatically good leaders?25 Sep 2019Institution News TeamGood leadership drives successCompetent engineers often stand out and tend to move to more senior positions， which creates the need for leadership responsibilities and skills that are entirely different to the all-familiar technical know-how they will have amassed to advance.This is not uncommon at all. A recent study by the CIPD found that three quarters (72%) of UK organisations report a lack of leadership skills within their ranks.An ineffective leader does not need to be a tyrant， though. They may simply be a manager who is not aware of the most effective ways to provide feedback， support different personality types or spot when a member of their team is struggling.The importance of good leadershipResearch from Blanchard found that most organisations are around 5-10% less productive than they would be if they had good leadership in place. What’s more， as much as a third of staff turnover could be avoided through improved leadership skills.Good leaders get the best from their teams – they encourage an environment of trust which feeds motivation and develops loyalty. With better leadership also comes improved staff morale and retention – and fewer recruitment costs.A good leader’s ‘halo effect’ seems to create benefits beyond their own team， positively affecting the organisation as a whole. When engineering organisations have strong leaders， they tend to communicate better and break down silos – encouraging innovation and improved performance. Enhancing leadership skills among senior staff boosts customer satisfaction scores as supported by consultancy Zenger-Folkman， finding that strong leaders can double business profits.The good news is that leadership skills which can be learntAlthough some lucky people are born with the right leadership skills， most will have to work hard to learn and develop and refine this skillset.Leadership trainingprovides a balance of ‘soft’， interpersonal skills that are invaluable for getting the best out of teams， developing a vision which gets others on board， and the ‘hard’ tangible skills required to set objectives in complex engineering environments.The Institution’s training team has over 30 years’ experience in transforming talented technical professionals into leaders of the future.Find out how we can help youShare:Read more related articlesCareersPlease enable JavaScript to view thecomments powered by Disqus.,

2019-09-20,美国科学促进会,Science in the Classroom Prepares Instructors to Teach New Research,课堂上的科学为教授新研究做好了准备,Science instructors are returning to the classroom this fall equipped to use newly published scientific research into their lessons after taking part in a workshop held by the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s Science in the Classroom program.Thirty high school and college science instructors participated in the August professional development workshop at AAAS headquarters that introduced them to Science in the Classroom’s primary literature resources and guided them on applying these methods in their own classrooms to enhance students’ understanding of scientific concepts， the contemporary practice of science and the real people behind scientific breakthroughs.Research has shown that there are many benefits to using primary literature as an instructional tool， said Shelby Lake， Science in the Classroom’s director of strategy and content. Students gain understanding of science concepts and practices when learning from primary literature， which also offers them a chance to experience a more in-depth understanding of cutting-edge work.“You don’t need to wait for it to be canonized and put into a textbook，” said Lake.Yet using primary literature in the classroom comes with challenges: Complicated technical jargon and advanced methodologies may be impenetrable to readers who are not already experts， Lake said.To address such concerns， Science in the Classroom has built a freely available online library of primary literature from the Science family of journals. To make the work more readily understandable， volunteers – graduate students， postdocs and others with relevant advanced degrees – annotate the papers with notes and comments， which serve as “scaffolding” for students and other non-specialists to navigate the article， said Lake.The annotations， which are overlaid onto the paper， can include a recap of previous work on the topic， a glossary of terms used in the article， more information about the paper’s experiments and results， and links to news coverage about the study and any policies developed in response to the results.The study’s authors then review the annotations for accuracy， and Science in the Classroom staff review annotations to ensure the material is at the correct learning level – the papers are intended to be used in introductory college coursework.Since 2013， the program has made available more than 100 annotated papers along with collections of topic-specific materials and guides for educators. In addition to their library of materials， the program has also expanded the reach of their workshops for educators， holding workshops in California， New Jersey and Tennessee this year in addition to Washington， D.C.， Lake said.The Aug. 15 interactive session began by working with one paper that is part of Science in the Classroom’s collection of annotated works: “Empathy and pro-social behavior in rats，” published in Science in 2011. Participants examined the original paper and considered what resources their students might need as they paraphrased the abstract. The exercise showed just how challenging the language used in scientific papers can be. Participants also drew pictures of the experimental setup， demonstrating how different learning styles and skills can be used to engage with and better understand the material.Educators also drafted their own lesson plans based on a paper of their choice， aligning with the educational standards that govern which scientific concepts students need to learn.Workshop participants also learned about the CREATE method – consider， read， elucidate the hypotheses， analyze and interpret the data， and think of the next experiment – a method that helps students understand and engage both with scientific concepts and the science being practiced by scientists today. In classrooms using the method， students design their own follow-up experiments to a paper they just read and hold mock grant panels to select the best proposals for further study.Participants also worked together to brainstorm additional ways that their students can better engage with the paper and its contents， such as encouraging students to reach out to paper authors by email. Teachers who already incorporate this into their teaching reported that students often get in-depth responses from scientists – a connection that helps humanize the people behind the discoveries.It is rare that a single scientist is the sole author of a paper， so examining primary literature helps students see that contemporary science is a collaborative process， said Lydia Kaprelian， editorial manager of Science in the Classroom. When looking at authors of a scientific research paper， students often find a diversity of scientists， from a mix of disciplines and different parts of the country and the world.“Looking at primary sources shows the diversity of scientists in every sense of the word，” said Kaprelian.,

2019-09-13,美国机械工程师协会 ,ASME Executive Internship Program Offers Students Valuable Experience,ASME高管实习项目为学生提供了宝贵的经验,This summer， a group of six engineering students from the New York City region took part in a new initiative， the ASME Executive Internship Program， which provided them with the opportunity to acquire some on-the-job experience and hone their communication skills while also giving them a first-hand understanding of ASME’s day-to-day operations.During their 10-week internships， the six students ― Brianna Migliaccio， a senior at New York University; Noah Ensslin， a sophomore at Stevens Institute of Technology; Kaelaan Maynor， a senior at the University of Hartford; Rosaura Ocampo， a senior from NYU; Sam Rappaport， a senior at NYU; and Xuezhi (Liam) Wang， a graduate student at Cornell University ― worked with various ASME groups to identify and develop opportunities that would enable the Society to better engage with engineering students and early career engineers. The new program was led and administered by ASME’s Executive Office， under Allian Pratt， managing director， Global Alliances and Board Outreach， and Karen Russo， director， Board Operations and Outreach.Each week， the interns met with a different ASME team ― ranging from members of ASME’s Membership， Programs and Philanthropy， and Standards & Certification departments to representatives from the Society’s Biomedical Division and the ASME INSPIRE program. After learning about each group’s staff and receiving an overview of the projects they were currently working on， the interns were asked to propose a solution to a particular problem or issue the group was facing.At the end of each week， the interns pitched their ideas to the group during a final presentation that was followed by a question-and-answer session. “Every Friday we present a pitch deck of all our solutions — a new business model or an analysis of the target market — and demonstrate our research for the week and offer our suggestions from an engineer’s and student’s perspective，” explained Migliaccio， who is chair of her ASME student section at NYU.These weekly presentations， which were recorded to enable the interns to review them， turned out to be a valuable feature of the summer internship， the students said. Ensslin， for one， welcomed the opportunity to refine his public-speaking skills. “As a sophomore， I haven’t really had any presentation experience outside of classrooms，” he said. “So it was nice to get that entirely different perspective and have a very formal pitch each week.”In addition to developing and presenting their weekly pitches， which included new concepts for membership benefits and the expansion of an Engineering for Change (E4C) competition pilot program into the United States， the interns also worked on side projects such as preparing business proposals for a proposed podcast for engineering professionals and a phone app for centralizing ASME’s online resources.The internship program also offered the students a first-hand opportunity to observe the inner workings of ASME.“One big thing I got out of the program was being able to see how an organization operates and its operational structure， because that’s something that I didn’t know anything about before，” said Maynor， who is now a senior at the University of Hartford. “You get to see how things run down through a chain of command， how decisions get made， what the different processes are that you have to go through in order to make those decisions， who you need to speak to — things like that. These are helpful to know because they’re what I’ll have to take into consideration when I’m starting a new project or a new committee when working with ASME or another organization.”Ocampo， who is vice chair of NYU’s student section， was particularly enthusiastic about her summer-long experience. “If I had the option of doing this internship all over again， I would redo it，” she said. “It has been great.”Valentina Alayon， who supervised the internship program， was also pleased with the inaugural class of students. “They’ve all been a really impressive group and they’ve come very far，” said Alayon， coordinator， Student and Early Career Engagement and Experience. “I’m really proud of the work that they’ve done and how they’re represented the first batch of Executive Interns.”,
2019-09-12,美国计算机学会,How Vocational Education Got a 21st Century Reboot,职业教育如何在21世纪重新启动,Erick Trickey is a writer in Boston.NEWBURGH， N.Y. — Suriana Rodriguez is only 19， but she’s already lined up a full-time job at IBM. After her junior year in high school， she interned at the tech giant’s Poughkeepsie， N.Y.， campus， 20 miles north of her hometown， for $17 an hour. For a year， Rodriguez has worked 40-hour weeks as an apprentice test technician， examining IBM mainframes to confirm they work before shipping them to customers. In January， she’ll move to a permanent position with a future salary that she says is “definitely much more than I ever thought I’d be making at 19.”Rodriguez’s opportunities with IBM came to her thanks to her high school， Newburgh Free Academy P-TECH. It’s part of an innovative public-school model that combines grade 9-12 education with internships and tuition-free community college. P-TECH， which stands for Pathways in Technology Early College High School， has spread to 10 states and 17 countries since its founding in Brooklyn in 2011. The P-TECH network is growing fast. By the end of 2019， there will be 220 P-TECH schools in operation. With 93，000 students nationwide， it is one of the most extensive career and technical education programs in the United States.Story Continued BelowFor public school districts， starting P-TECH schools is a way to try to address the “skills gap”—American education’s often-elusive goal of tying vocational training to what actual employers such as IBM and Cisco and Microsoft want. It focuses on the much-valued STEM subjects—science， technology， engineering and math. It aims to prepare students for so-called new collar jobs: work in tech that requires more than a high school diploma， but not always a four-year college degree. And at a time when free college education is surging toward the top of the progressive agenda， it’s an affordable free-college program that’s taken root in poorer cities， boosting high school graduation rates and two-year-college completion rates among students of color and immigrants.P-TECH interns showed off their projects at an exposition hosted by IBM in Poughkeepsie， N.Y. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico MagazineIn 2014， Newburgh， an industrial city of 28，000 in New York’s Hudson Valley， was struggling with widespread abandoned properties and the state’s highest murder rate. A majority-Hispanic city where 31 percent of people are impoverished， Newburgh embraced a statewide expansion of the P-TECH program as a strategy for building opportunity. It launched its P-TECH school with a class of 50 ninth-graders.Did you have a non-traditional college experience? Leave us a voicemail at (202) 922-6112 and we might share your story.Rodriguez signed up. “Since none of my family had ever really graduated from high school or college，” she says， “I was very interested in the aspect of getting a free college degree.” Rodriguez and 16 classmates who jumped onto P-TECH’s fast track finished the six-year program in four years.In spring 2018， Rodriguez graduated with both a high school diploma and an associate’s degree in cybersecurity from Orange County Community College. An undocumented immigrant， Rodriguez couldn’t get federal financial aid to attend a four-year college. But she’s authorized to work through the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program， so she took advantage of another part of P-TECH’s model: a job interview with IBM after graduation. This August， she became the first Newburgh P-TECH grad to get a full-time job with IBM. Earlier this year， she spoke， along with IBM CEO Ginni Rometty， at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Rodriguez is now a night-school student at Dutchess Community College， with a goal of getting a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in two years， and a master’s in five years.Newburgh， N.Y. has struggled with unemployment and crime. Mayor Torrance Harvey， bottom right， believes the P-TECH program can help the city improve its economic profile by training students to fill well-paying jobs in the area. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico MagazineRodriguez is the first Newburgh graduate to go from IBM intern to apprentice to full employee， but others are likely to follow soon. IBM， which helped launch the first P-TECH school in 2011， is now affiliated with at least 30 P-TECHs worldwide. It has hired 30 of the 240 students who’ve graduated from IBM-affiliated P-TECHs so far， paying each a starting salary of at least $50，000.Story Continued Below“The P-TECH experience really helped me feel more confident overall， and it helped me learn a lot of skills that I am still today using，” says Rodriguez， “like collaborating and communicating， professional e-mail writing， and knowing when to ask questions and when to just listen.”Newburgh’s mayor， Torrance Harvey， is also a full-time P-TECH history teacher. He says the school helps Newburgh’s efforts to recover from its early-2010s crime epidemic. “Public safety is always our No. 1 priority， but the next thing is how to create meaningful employment for our residents，” Harvey says. Newburgh P-TECH students complete associate’s degrees in either computer networking or cybersecurity—fast-growing fields， Harvey notes， whose importance has grown after Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election and enormous data breaches suffered by corporate giants such as Target and Equifax.“These are inner-city Newburgh kids，” the mayor says of his P-TECH students， “and this program has changed the trajectory of their earning potential and their career potential and their education.”Newburgh’s P-TECH campus opened in 2014. Principal Kevin Rothman talks to Mayor Torrance Harvey， who also teaches history at P-TECH. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico MagazineNewburgh’s trajectory is changing too. Gun violence has declined 80 percent since 2015. City Hall has launched an aggressive revitalization plan， bulldozing buildings that had stood abandoned for decades. “We were able to get businesses to return back to the city，” Harvey says. “We were able to get new home ownership. People are investing in our city like you wouldn’t believe.”***The P-TECH idea was invented in 2010， when then-IBM CEO Sam Palmisano was chatting up his friend Joel Klein， then New York City’s schools chancellor. During a rain delay at the U.S. Open tennis tournament， Palmisano told Klein that the tech industry was having trouble finding young people with the skills it needed. Klein proposed opening a six-year school with the City University of New York and curriculum input from IBM. Students could work IBM internships and， if they passed a company certification test， would be first in line for job interviews at IBM. Palmisano agreed. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced the plan in September 2010 and gave the partners a year to open the school.When Klein and Palmisano shook on the deal， vocational education was just beginning to emerge from the academic backwater where it had languished for decades. Conceived a century ago so high school students could learn a trade if they weren’t going to college， vocational education had developed a reputation as a dumping ground for students who weren’t doing well in regular academics. Harvard’s influential Pathways to Prosperity report， released in 2011， warned that nearly two-thirds of new jobs of the 2010s would require more than a high school education—yet only 40 percent of Americans had obtained a bachelor’s degree or associate’s degree by their mid-20s.Downtown Newburgh has been hit hard economically. Vincent Lacertosa， 18， from Newburgh， is a P-TECH graduate and an apprentice at IBM where he tests main frame computers. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico MagazineBy contrast， the report noted， 40 to 70 percent of high school kids in many European countries spent three years in career programs that combined classroom and workplace experience， where they earned diplomas or certificates strongly valued in the labor market. Eight years later， critics of American career and technical education， as it’s called today， still complain that it needs to become more academically rigorous， better prepare students for education beyond high school， and provide actual work experience based on the needs of today’s employers.The first P-TECH， in Brooklyn， emulated the workplace learning focus of European vocational education while eliminating tuition costs. It established design principles that still apply to all the 200-plus P-TECH schools today. The entire program， including the community college courses， is cost-free. (P-TECH schools are funded through various combinations of local tax dollars， state funding， federal career-ed grants， and cost-sharing with local community colleges.) They’re open-enrollment schools， with no testing or grade requirements for admission， and they focus on disadvantaged youth. The high school， the community college and the industry partner work together. The curriculum includes workplace skills， such as public speaking， as well as company mentors and paid internships. Graduates are first in line for job interviews at the partner company.Suriana Rodriguez， 19， is the first Newburgh P-TECH graduate to get a full-time job offer from IBM. She’s currently an apprentice at IBM’s campus in Poughkeepsie， above. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico MagazinePolitical leaders quickly embraced the model， excited by its combination of career and technical education， paid internships and early college. Barack Obama praised Brooklyn’s P-TECH in his 2013 State of the Union address and visited the school later that year. “This is a ticket into the middle class， and it’s available to everybody who’s willing to work for it，” Obama said in an address at the school.A year earlier， in 2012， Chicago’s then-mayor， Rahm Emanuel， had inked a deal with IBM， Microsoft， Cisco， Verizon and Motorola to open five P-TECHs there. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo debuted a state P-TECH program in 2014， pledging $28 million over seven years for 18 new schools， including Newburgh’s. Connecticut opened its first P-TECH school， in Norwalk， in 2014， with then-Gov. Dannel Malloy cutting the ceremonial ribbon. P-TECH schools are popular in Northeastern cities and states， but have also caught on in Dallas， Baton Rouge and Colorado. Though Democratic governors and mayors have championed them， their public-private collaborations have also won over Larry Hogan， Maryland’s Republican governor.Danille Jager is the liaison between Newburgh P-Tech and IBM. At a recent exposition for P-TECH interns， attendees got their passports stamped after they heard presentations from the students. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico MagazineIn Baltimore， a conversation between Hogan and Johns Hopkins University President Ron Daniels， soon after the city’s 2015 riots， led to the creation of two P-TECH schools in 2016. One is affiliated with IBM， while the other， located on the edge of Johns Hopkins’ hospital campus， is focused on health care， with the hospital and Kaiser Permanente as industry partners. This summer， 10 of its 200 students completed internships at the University of Maryland’s shock trauma center and John Hopkins’ anesthesiology， neurology and orthopedics departments.Now， eight P-TECH schools are operating in Maryland， including four in Baltimore， with some state funding. The Maryland Chamber of Commerce has organized a consortium of 400 businesses to offer mentors， internships and job interviews to P-TECH students. “The challenge in the P-TECH schools is not whether or not the individual jurisdiction wants to do it，” says Keiffer Mitchell， a special adviser to Hogan. “It’s just finding enough businesses that can take on internships for the kids， and also have ideas [about] hiring those kids.”This May， Hogan signed a bill allowing for three more P-TECH schools in Maryland， after the state Senate killed his proposal to remove a state cap on the program’s expansion. “We’re not against it，” Paul Pinsky， chairman of the Maryland Senate’s education committee， told the Baltimore Sun. “It’s just we haven’t gotten the data back about whether it’s working or not.”Results have taken a while to emerge， since P-TECH schools are six-year programs， and most aren’t six years old yet. But the inaugural class at the original P-TECH in Brooklyn achieved a stunning 100 percent high school graduation rate， followed by 87 percent for the second class and 93 percent for the third—compared with graduation rates of 71-74 percent for their peers across New York City. Fifty-seven percent of the first class and 39 percent of the second class also graduated with the no-cost associate degree in a computer science field. Brooklyn P-TECH’s principal， Rashid Davis， notes that many students who didn’t get the associate degree took college courses， then transferred the credits to four-year colleges.At Norwalk High School in Connecticut， P-TECH students study web design. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico MagazineAbout 70 percent of the Brooklyn P-TECH students are low income. Just under a third of the student body female and 55 percent of the students are black males. And P-TECH is not achieving those high graduation rates by taking it easy on the students. Davis says students at the open-enrollment Brooklyn P-TECH are achieving results on New York state college-readiness tests that are comparable with New York City’s screened and specialized high schools.“Students are buying into the culture，” Davis says. “Our attendance rate still hovers above 90 percent. That is a key indicator that students are wanting to be in this environment.”***Vocational education used to teach students how to weld or how to fix a car. Today’s career and technical education means something much different. Students are learning to code software， design websites， or operate robots and AI systems that have replaced manual-labor jobs across much of the economy.China Tinnen and Nico Tullio are juniors in the P-TECH program at Norwalk High School. As part of the six-year program， P-TECH students take classes at nearby Norwalk Community College. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico MagazineThis August， rising seniors at the P-TECH high school in Norwalk， Conn.， gathered at Norwalk Community College for the P-TECH Norwalk Intern Expo. To mark the end of their summer internships， the students gave presentations on their work for their parents and their IBM mentors.Bianca Velez and Pongsa Tayjasanant， both 17， stood behind a table and told passersby what they did with their summer. For eight weeks， at IBM’s offices in White Plains， N.Y. (a half-hour from Norwalk via school bus)， they worked in IBM’s digital sales team. They used the company’s Watson Language Translator， an artificial intelligence tool， to translate sales documents for IBM employees around the world.Bianca Velez and Christian Tapper， both P-TECH students， take classes at Norwalk Community College. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine“Instead of translating word for word like Google Translate， it looks at a document holistically，” Tayjasanant explained， his polished presentation reflecting the public-speaking element in P-TECH’s curriculum. “It’s able to keep the tone， able to keep the diction， the nuances to language that are so important.”Velez and Tayjasanant have each taken seven college courses already. They’re on track to graduate next spring， in four years instead of six， with associate’s degrees as well as high school diplomas. At first， says Velez， “the personal draw to me was， obviously， free college.” Then she embraced P-TECH Norwalk’s path toward an associate’s degree in web development. “I’m really into things like design. I was thinking， maybe learning how to code and design websites was something I would really like to do.” Now she knows she likes coding websites， but she’s also considering careers in chemistry or chemical engineering， attending a four-year college， and working with IBM.Velez’s mother， Annette Velez， says P-TECH， especially its college classes and public-speaking course， have helped her daughter grow as a student. “She was a very timid child，” she recalls. “Now she’s very open， loves talking， sharing ideas.”Karen Amaker， principal of Norwalk High School， in a P-TECH web design class. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico MagazineKaren Amaker， has been the principal at P-TECH Norwalk since 2014， when it was founded as Norwalk Early College Academy and adopted the P-TECH curriculum. She says the model works for students like Velez and Tayjasanant—“our high flyers who are on that fast track”— and for the typical P-TECH student， who completes the program in 5½ to six years. “For those families for whom college wasn’t necessarily in their plan—not because they didn’t want it， because they didn’t see it as accessible—I think P-TECH makes that accessibility and opportunity very much visible.” Most P-TECH Norwalk students go on to pursue a four-year degree， Amaker says， and some choose careers outside tech. For instance， a recent graduate， accepted into the Rhode Island School of Design， didn’t finish the associate’s degree， but transferred her college credits to her new school.The Norwalk school， one of four P-TECH schools in Connecticut， launched with state funding. When that dried up after a year， Norwalk Community College’s then-president used discretionary funds to pay for the students’ free college courses. Now P-TECH receives an extra $1，000 per pupil from the Norwalk school district to help cover the cost. Pell grants also help， as does federal funding from the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act.“I think one of the biggest mistakes I’ve seen in education is this trend to do away with technical skills，” Amaker says. Instead， she says， schools need to “help students to develop those skills， be that auto mechanics， computer science， [or] now culinary arts， and all the things in between. We have to move away from this cookie-cutter model of doing education as rote memorization and really think about project-based learning and design thinking.”This article tagged under: Education,

2019-09-11,美国计算机学会,States With More Computer Science Policies See Increased Female Participation,拥有更多计算机科学政策的州，女性参与的比例有所增加,Only 45% of high schools in the U.S. teach computer science， and females and minority students are still underrepresented in these classes， according to a report released Wednesday by Code.org Advocacy Coalition， the Computer Science Teachers Association and the Expanding Computing Education Pathways Alliance.In order to help close these gaps， the Code.org Advocacy Coalition， which is working to make computer science a fundamental part of the k-12 education system， created nine policy recommendations for states. According to the report， states that have adopted at least one of these policies now have more schools that teach computer science classes， and more female students taking Advanced Placement computer science programs.The coalition encourages states to create a state plan for K-12 computer science， to establish "rigorous" computer science standards and to fund computer science training for teachers. The coalition also suggests that states create clear certification pathways for teachers， establish programs at higher education institutions as a resource for educators who wish to teach computer science， and create computer science positions in state and local education agencies， as well as require all secondary schools to offer computer science， and allow computer science to satisfy a core requirement and an admission requirement at higher education institutions.According to Code.org， states that have adopted between one and four of the recommendations are seeing a 39% increase in the number of high schools teaching computer science programs， while those that have adopted all nine policies have seen a 65% increase.Only 14 states plus D.C. had at least one of the nine policies in place in 2013 when the coalition began its work. In 2018， 44 states had adopted at least one of the policies， and Code.org says all 50 states are now enforcing， or are in the process of implementing， at least one of the recommendations. Arkansas， Idaho， Indiana， Maryland and Nevada have adopted all nine policies."Just six years ago， not a single state considered K-12 computer science education a priority，" Cameron Wilson， president of the Code.org Advocacy Coalition， said in a press release for the report. "Today， states are competing to see who can offer the best computer science education for their students."During this timeframe， the national percentage of female and minority students who took the Advanced Placement computer science exam increased significantly， growing from 16.7% to 28% for female students and from 13% to 21.8% for minority students.The report notes that it's impossible to attribute these increases to specific policies， but the organizations involved say there's a positive correlation between the number of recommendations a state adopts and the percentage of female students taking the AP exam. The relationship between these policies and the percentage of minority students taking the exam showed no correlation.In the report's press release， Microsoft President Brad Smith stressed how crucial it is that state leaders provide every young person the opportunity to learn computer science.,

2019-09-09,土木工程师学会,ICE WM and Enginuity aim for world record with bridge made of Lego bricks,以乐高积木搭成的桥梁，创造世界纪录,Yvonne Aust， ICE Shropshire Branch Chair， officially opens the bridge.Updated: 09 September， 201909 September， 2019 Author: Jo BarnettThe Institution of Civil Engineers West Midlands， together with Ironbridge Gorge Museums ， is attempting to break the Guinness World Record for a bridge with the longest span made from interlocking plastic bricks.The bridge went on view at Enginuity in Telford on Saturday， 31 August and stretches the length of the museum at its Coalbrookdale site.The new bridge has a record span of 16.91m， is 34m long and contains around 205，000 bricks. This potentially beats the existing record of a span of 16.46m， which was achieved by the Institution of Civil Engineers on 5 September 2016， and will be officially verified in the next few months.ICE West Midlands' attempt at breaking the Guinness World Record.Enginuity was chosen by ICE for this world record attempt because both organisations are dedicated to inspiring engineers of the future with engineers of the past.Commenting on the partnership with the Ironbridge Gorge Museums， Jo Barnett， Regional Director ICE West Midlands， said: “We are delighted to be working with Enginuity to showcase the new model bridge with its record span."Enginuity welcomes children from all over the country and the hope is that the bridge and additional activities will encourage more children to consider civil engineering as a profession. Civil engineers really do shape the world and touch every part of our lives. It is truly an exciting sector to be involved in.”The role of an engineer has changed through the centuries from the first Industrial Revolution in the Ironbridge Gorge back in the 18th century to what is now recognised as the fourth Industrial Revolution.Rapidly emerging from the third， it's regarded as a new era， rather than a continuation， because of the explosiveness of its development fusing physical and digital technologies， reflected in Enginuity’s fab lab and newer exhibits.Ed Diment from Bright Bricks added: "We are very excited to be working with the ICE to install the world's longest span bridge built with plastic interlocking bricks."Working with the ICE， the record was set back in 2016， but this new installation extends that length to set a new record with a central span of some 16.91m. We are hoping that this installation will inspire a new generation of children to take up a career in engineering when they see what is possible with toy bricks."The bridge will be on display at the museum throughout the Ironbridge Gorge World Heritage's two-week long Festival of Imagination， which runs between 14 and 29 September 2019 and beyond. One of the 10 Ironbridge Gorge Museums， Enginuity ， is open daily 10am until 4pm.For further information， call the Ironbridge Tourist Information Centre on 01952 433 424 or visit www.ironbridge.org.uk .

2019-09-09,美国计算机学会,Raspberry Pi launches Isaac Computer Science to promote STEM,树莓派推出艾萨克计算机科学促进茎,The project is funded by the Department for Education’s National Centre for Computing Education programme. It’s based on a similar initiative the University of Cambridge runs called Isaac Physics， and makes use of the same back-end systems.Isaac Computer Science provides a range of free online learning materials for the classroom， along with homework and revision.Speaking with EW， Duncan Maidens， Raspberry Pi’s director of computer science education said， “It has long been recognised that Computer Science education in schools was seriously lacking and failing to provide the numbers of students needed to enter the digital sector.“In addition it also failed to provide a general computing education for all to become ‘digitally’ aware. Thus the development is timely in providing continuous support for computer science education， preparing students for further study or entry into the workforce and tomorrow’s ever more digital age.”The platform’s resources are mapped to A-level specifications in England (including the AQA and OCR exam boards). Teachers can set assignments for students within Isaac and have the platform mark work automatically. “The resources cover a total of 45 topics from programming and networks， to data representation and Boolean logic，” Maidens continues.“Graded help is provided to encourage further study. Evidence has shown this is more effective in developing a deeper understanding than just being presented with the correct answers.”For further support， Raspberry Pi will be running free student workshops and teacher CPD events at universities and schools around England. Tickets for the events are available to book through the Isaac Computer Science website.James Spencer， computer science teacher at St Martin’s School said “Isaac Computer Science helped equip me with the skills to teach A level， and ran a great workshop at one of their recent Discovery events using the micro:bit and the Kitronik :MOVE mini. This is a session that I’ll definitely be using again and again.”Isaac Computer Science isn’t Raspberry Pi’s foray into education. Picademy， launched in 2014， is a face-to-face CPD training event held at venues around the UK and North America. Its goal is to “provide educators with the knowledge and skills they need to teach computing with confidence creativity and excitement” and the next event scheduled will be held at the University of Bath on the 26-27 October.,

2019-08-27,美国科学促进会,Support Networks for STEM Teachers Can Improve Retention,对STEM教师的支持网络可以提高保留率,Ensuring that current and future teachers of science， technology， engineering and mathematics have strong support networks emerged as an important strategy for retaining well-trained educators in school districts most in need of them， according to presenters and attendees of the 2019 Noyce Summit.The Noyce Summit， co-hosted by the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s STEM Education Program and the National Science Foundation’s Division of Undergraduate Education， brought together educators， researchers and administrators to explore the goal of retaining STEM teachers in classrooms and identify how teacher preparation programs can best prepare teachers for the challenges of the classroom.The importance of community and support networks for educators was a message delivered by numerous summit presenters and participants， including early-career teachers， researchers sharing their findings to improve teacher retention and summit attendees reflecting on the importance of the Noyce community.The summit is the annual gathering of the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program， which encourages individuals studying STEM or working in STEM professions to become elementary， middle and high school STEM teachers. The nationwide program provides funding to researchers studying science education， teacher recruitment and retention. It also provides scholarships and fellowships to experienced “master” teachers and to STEM majors who commit to teaching in high-needs school districts – those with a high percentage of students from families living below the poverty line， elevated teacher turnover rates and high rates of untrained teachers.“My life changed forever by empowered teachers，” said Shirley Malcom， AAAS senior adviser and head of the SEA Change program， during the July summit， emphasizing the impact that well-trained， motivated teachers can have on their students.No single tactic will solve STEM teacher retention， Malcom noted， in keeping with the summit’s agenda that explored the issue from many angles. Noyce Summit attendees shared their findings and experiences in 65 workshops on educational practices and subjects ranging from field experience to culturally relevant teaching. The agenda also included presentations of more than 170 posters highlighting the research of Noyce funding recipients and small-group discussions centered on the summit’s theme and numerous networking opportunities. One new event was a speed-dating-inspired opportunity called Speed STEMming for Noyce scholars and fellows to connect with 20 different organizations offering curriculum and professional development resources.Among the five plenaries was the perennially popular and relevant “Voices from the Field” panel， which brings together Noyce alumni early in their teaching careers to discuss the challenges and successes of early-career STEM teachers.Teachers emphasized the importance of having their own support networks as they strive to encourage their students. Jonathan Isozaki， a graduate of Loyola Marymount University teaching high school mathematics in California， recounted the best advice he received as a novice teacher: “Find that support system.”Panelists noted that such networks have been important in dealing with the issues they have faced while teaching in high-need schools， including carrying a heavy workload as the school’s only science teacher， instructing students who are several grade levels behind in STEM and supporting students in communities where drug and alcohol abuse and suicide are common.The panelists also shared what they wished had been a part of their teacher training programs to better address challenges they have faced. Jamie McDonald， a graduate of Bridgewater State University and an elementary school STEM teacher in Massachusetts， said trauma training would be a useful addition to teacher training curricula to understand how trauma can negatively affect students and their ability to learn. Isozaki said he wished he had been instructed in classroom management techniques. “Without it， you can’t teach your subject，” he said.The subject of support systems also emerged at another plenary in which Noyce-funded researchers shared their findings on teacher preparation programs that could determine whether a first-year teacher stays on for a second year and beyond.Meltem Alemdar， associate director and senior research scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology’s Center for Education Integrating Science， Mathematics and Computing， has studied teachers’ personal networks and the effects they have on teacher retention. She found that teachers whose support network includes others who work in education are more likely to remain in the profession.Alemdar has also focused on the concept of self-efficacy – belief in one’s own ability to succeed in a given situation – which can be bolstered by a strong social network. Receiving constructive feedback as part of a teacher preparation program “always boosts my confidence，” she reports one participant in her study saying.Attendees of the Noyce Summit also reported that the summit itself serves as a space for support and inspiration. The summit is “a really valuable opportunity to connect with other people who run similar types of programs to see what kind of innovations they are implementing，” said Ed Himelblau， professor at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and primary investigator on a Noyce grant to research the recruitment of STEM majors into teaching.Noyce Summit attendee Amy Wagler， associate professor of mathematical sciences at University of Texas El Paso and a primary investigator of a Noyce-funded study to analyze the social networks of novice STEM teachers， affirmed the importance of connection among professionals. New teachers are frequently in a “sink or swim” situation， Wagler said， and their ability to cope depends strongly on the people with whom they can talk about their work. Referring to the Noyce community， Wagler said， “Now I have my own support network.”[Associated image: Colella Digital],

Or， maybe he is recording educational videos on preventing ear infections. She might even be running for city council.Nurses are taking on new and expanded roles in health care， a prominent theme at the National Academy of Medicine’s (NAM) three regional town halls this summer on the future of nursing. As health care becomes more complex and stretches beyond traditional settings， nurses are charting new paths in areas such as health system leadership， clinical research， and digital health.The three town halls， held in Philadelphia， Chicago， and Seattle， will inform NAM’s Future of Nursing 2020-2030 study， which is looking at the opportunities and challenges facing the profession in the next decade. Nurses who attended discussed how an aging population， emerging technologies， and evolving curriculum and continuing education opportunities are inherently changing their profession.However， some things remain the same — nurses are one of the first lines of defense for addressing many of the social and economic stressors that can impact people’s health， whether that’s food insecurity， homelessness， or transportation barriers.Making Nurses Lifelong LearnersUnderstanding how social determinants affect health outcomes should be standard curriculum for nursing education， said panelists at the June 7 Chicago town hall. But that’s not always the case.Susan Swider， a professor in the Department of Community， Systems and Mental Health Nursing at Rush University， encouraged attendees to be lifelong learners. “We need more robust continuing education. Once you reach a Ph.D.， you can’t be ‘pinnacled out，’” she said.She and other attendees emphasized the urgency of revising curriculum now — not three or four years from now — to be agile and responsive to the fast-changing world of population health.“I envision a nurse researcher working for the Department of Housing and Urban Development， evaluating the health outcomes of affordable and stable housing. Or working with their city council to help them integrate a health-in-all-policies approach to decision-making，” said Janice Phillips， director of nursing research and health equity at Rush University.Moving Beyond Clinical CareDuring the July 24 town hall in Philadelphia， Antonia Villarruel， dean of the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing， shared nurse-led community health initiatives from around the country that focused on the health of migrant workers， firearm violence prevention， and the heart health of formerly incarcerated black men. “Nurses have to work at all levels， not just clinical care，” said Villarruel.It’s critical that nurses are able to practice to the highest level of their education and training， working as a team with medical providers， social workers， and public health professionals， attendees said.University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing Dean Antonia Villarruel shows Philadelphia town hall attendees the many faces of nursing. Credit: Michael FisherBalancing High-Tech with the Human TouchNurses should embrace their role as “cross-sector data sharing champions，” said Eli Kern， an epidemiologist at the King County Department of Public Health， during the August 7 town hall in Seattle. When data remains in silos， “we reach incomplete conclusions， and those incomplete conclusions could lead us to incomplete priority areas – which drives funding.”Molly McCarthy， national director， U.S. provider industry and Chief Nursing Officer at Microsoft， applauds this new wave of digitally savvy nurses who are interpreting data， creating apps， and even starting their own tech companies. For example， at Providence Health System in Seattle， nurses created an app that helped reduce unnecessary C-sections.“Digital transformation doesn’t always mean using the latest and greatest tech. It could mean taking information that was in a binder and digitizing it，” said McCarthy. “As nurses， we are critical in this digital transformation， whether you work at a hospital， in the home， in industry， or you see patients virtually.”Imagining Future Roles for NursesWhile technology is promising， it is not a panacea or a magic wand that can remove structural inequities in health care.Whether it’s through volunteer work， serving on boards， or assuming leadership roles in research and administration， nurses can become advocates for social change， said Chicago town hall speaker Coletta Barrett， vice president of mission at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center， and chair of the Baton Rouge Mayor’s Task Force on Health and Well-Being.“There are 3.9 million nurses in the U.S. Imagine the future if you can unlock and harness the passion in each of us，” Barrett said. “We have to always remember why we got into this， and give people equal opportunity to act on their ‘why.’”,

2019-01-14,英国工程技术学会,IET challenges young entrepreneurs to ‘Save our Seas’ and solve real world plastic and toxic waste threat,IET挑战年轻企业家“拯救我们的海洋”，解决现实世界塑料和有毒废物的威胁,80% of marine litter originates from land with only 9% of plastic currently being recycled globally.Single-use plastic and cigarette butts are the biggest threat to oceans and marine life.IET Global Challenge encourages young professional engineers (aged 18-35) across the globe to address a real-world engineering challenge with their diverse academic and technical exposure.In addition， approximately four trillion cigarette butts have made their way into the waters， leaching hundreds of toxic chemicals each and adding to the biggest global threat of our generation.Partnering with Greenpeace and GreenSeas Trust， the IET has set two very different challenges， with teams needing to solve one of them to be in with the chance of working with organisations that can make a real difference.The Greenpeace challenge requires teams to think of ideas for reusable packaging designs or new approaches that enable supermarkets to dramatically reduce the need for packaging in the first place. According to Greenpeace， our oceans are slowly turning into a "plastic soup” with part of the problem being single-use plastic. This means that huge amounts of plastic， which can take hundreds of years to break down， are entering our oceans.GreenSeas wants teams to tackle the trillions of cigarettes currently in our waters， the number one item found on beach clean-ups. Teams are challenged to create a remotely controlled all-terrain machine that can move up and down the beach， picking up cigarette butts from the surface of the sand and collecting them in a chamber or hopper.A large proportion of plastic in our oceans is also due to "improperly disposed of rubbish" and accidental propagation by winds， drains and floods， according to GreenSeas Trust.Mike Carr， IET President， said: “This competition is all about giving young engineers a platform to highlight their innovations. By shining a light on a particular problem we’ve found that engineers think outside of the box and come up with innovative solutions.“Previous winners of this challenge have gone on to see their innovations become a reality， so this is a great way to make a difference and solve a real-world challenge.”The winning teams from both challenges will receive a £500 cash prize， trophy and an all-expenses-paid trip to attend the IET's prestigious Innovation Awards ceremony in London where their winning solution will be revealed to the audience.---ENDS---Notes to editors,
2018-10-22,德国工业研究联盟协会,The VDE Institute at Science Days 2018,2018年科学日VDE研究所,From October 18 to 20， roughly 90 companies， educational institutes and other institutions once again invited people to experiment， test， and design. Children and teens learned about a multitude of professions and degree programs. Furthermore， they marveled at the special phenomena of physics and chemistry at various science shows.This time， the VDE Institute brought along an electronics assembly kit， "VDE E-LAB live"， which students soldered into a robot with a temperature display. Of course， they were allowed to take them home as a reward–together with their personal junior tester certificate. In addition， the young recruits learned a thing or two about safely handling electricity and electronics. We even managed to get a few excited about a career in electrical engineering or information technology.,
2017-10-25,德国工业研究联盟协会,VDE at Science Days 2017,2017科学日VDE,The VDE Institute took part with the E-LAB live. Supported by students from Freiburg University， the pupils could make an electronic circuit in the form of a VDE guardian angel. It had touch sensors that made the eyes blink， as we as a temperature display. The children enjoyed soldering the individual components onto the circuit boards and screwing on the casing made by the 3D printer. If their circuits passed the function and safety tests， the pupils received a VDE junior test certificate.The aim of this initiative by VDE， which again sponsored the Science Days， and the VDE Institute was to interest children and young people in technical careers. Staff from the VDE Institute also informed pupils about safety when handling electricity and how important it is when buying electrical products to choose not necessarily the cheapest， but to look for quality and safety labels.,
